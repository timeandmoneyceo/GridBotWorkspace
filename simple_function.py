# Edit 1: Code enhancement: 2775 chars
# Edit 2: # Inline Comment on line (6): The loop logic is to iterate over all numbers, and sum them up one by each time until 0 or if a negative number has been encountered during iteration then stop the process which happens when we encounter an even negativ numeral. This helps in calculating only positive sums of numerical data
# Edit 3: # Iteration starts from here (5) onwards. This loop will run until result is not negative or all numbers are processed completely: 0 in this case (#<--Inside Function comment). If any negativ numeral encountered during iteration, the process stops ('if' condition), as per requirement mentioned above by task requirements
# Edit 4: # <- Inside main function comments (7)    &quot;) - Ends Main method, it'll be followed by return statement for result variable which will hold total sum. It may not seem necessary if we are only calling calculate_sum and returning the value but is added here as per requirement mentioned above (#<--Inside Function comment).
