    Optimized Error Handling mechanism for GridBot Backup.
    
    This function is designed to handle errors gracefully and maintain the efficiency of GridBot's performance in real-time trading systems.
    
    Parameters:
    event (asyncio.Event): An event object used for asynchronous communication between tasks.
