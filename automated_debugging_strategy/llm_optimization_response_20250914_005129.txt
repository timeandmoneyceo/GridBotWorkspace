Explanation of Optimizations:

1. **Multiprocessing**: The code now utilizes multiprocessing for parallel processing, which significantly improves execution speed by utilizing multiple CPU cores to optimize files simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large numbers of file paths.

2. **ProcessPoolExecutor**: The `ProcessPoolExecutor` class from the `concurrent.futures` module is used to create a pool of worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently. This allows for efficient use of system resources and improves overall performance.

3. **Parallel Processing**: The code now uses parallel processing to optimize files simultaneously, which reduces the time required to complete the optimization process.

4. **Efficiency Rate Calculation**: The efficiency rate is calculated based on the total number of optimizations applied divided by the total number of candidates processed. This provides a comprehensive measure of the optimization process's overall efficiency.

Note: If no meaningful optimizations are possible, respond with "NO_OPTIMIZATIONS_NEEDED" only.
