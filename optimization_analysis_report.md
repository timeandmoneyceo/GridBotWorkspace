   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved database migration efficiency

2. train_pytorch_predictor (Priority 7) ‚úÖ  
   - Optimized ML model training
   - Enhanced data preprocessing
   - Improved memory management

3. calculate_locked_funds (Priority 7) ‚úÖ
   - Optimized financial calculations
   - Enhanced order processing logic
   - Improved risk management

4. sync_balances (Priority 7) ‚úÖ
   - Fixed string operations
   - Enhanced retry logic
   - Improved balance synchronization

QUALITY ANALYSIS
================================================================================
üîç Code Improvement Categories:
