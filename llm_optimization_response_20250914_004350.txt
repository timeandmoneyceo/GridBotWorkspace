Explanation of Optimizations:

1. **Multiprocessing**: The code now uses multiprocessing to execute the optimization process in parallel for multiple files simultaneously, reducing execution time and improving overall efficiency. This is achieved by submitting tasks (optimizing each file) to a ProcessPoolExecutor instance.

2. **String Concatenation**: In the original code, string concatenation was used within loops to build optimized results. However, this approach can be inefficient for large datasets because it involves creating temporary strings and copying data between them. The optimized version uses list comprehensions instead of string concatenation, which is more memory-efficient and faster.

3. **Refactoring**: The code has been refactored to reduce repetition by extracting a separate method `_optimize_file` that encapsulates the optimization logic for each file. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

4. **Comprehensive Report Generation**: The comprehensive multi-file optimization report is now generated using list comprehensions, which are more efficient than string concatenation.

Note: If no meaningful optimizations are possible, you can respond with "NO_OPTIMIZATIONS_NEEDED".
